## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I cannot really say I learned much this time around. On the styling side of things this wa pretty good practice. However, when it comes to the behavior side, I was barely able to build a half-functioning app and ended up pretty frustrated for not being able to fix the things I know are wrong with my code.

### Continued development

I'd like to focus more on the things I was unable to accomplish succesfully. For example, the fact that the selecte percentage buttons don't become de-selected when clicking on a different one o the fact that the app only works when clicking on a percentage button and not when changing the input values in real time.
